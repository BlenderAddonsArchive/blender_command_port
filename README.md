### Basic usage

Command should be sent to command port as a text. It can be also done sent from Python:

```
import socket


def send_command(command):
    clientsocket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
    clientsocket.connect(('localhost', 5000))
    clientsocket.sendall(command.encode())
    while True:
        res = clientsocket.recv(4096)
        if not res:
            break
        print(res.decode())
    clientsocket.close()

send_command("""
j = 0
for i in range(10):
    print(j)
    j+=i*2
j
""")
```

Another way is to use execute_file_in_blender.py script to create a run configuration in PyCharm that executes a file in Blender. Path to a file must be passed as a first script parameter, port need to be passed as a second one.
